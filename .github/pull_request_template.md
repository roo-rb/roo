- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

If your change is a breaking change, please add a '!' after the type, e.g., 'feat!: ...'
